      A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists
      of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic
      hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
      timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,
      where data nodes are represented by leaves). <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Since
      each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively
      form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional
      block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions
      are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given
      block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent
      blocks.

      Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network
      for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to
      a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
      Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks
      are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify
      a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
